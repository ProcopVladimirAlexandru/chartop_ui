<h1>TODOs for frontend</h1>

* fix xTicks for charts. Unacceptable on large scale (J for july etc)
* add default zoom (ex. 1 year)
* group metrics to the right of chart by category and order them by category importance and inside that order them again so that they can be compared

* fix all the huge bugs : )
* fix left right scroll

* Add Last Entry: 20 March 2024 => Change "Rate of Change from 6 Months Ago" => "Rate of Change in previous 6 Months Ago" - because the last entry may be some time ago
